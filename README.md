# Investing-for-Noobs-App
A simple compound interest calculator for Android made with Kotlin 

NOTE: Original name "Investing for Noobs" does not match App name "Compound Interest Calculator"
      I might add more fragments (pages) to the app later to build onto it. 
      I would like to make the app a beginner guide (learning tool) to understand 
      different investment products and strategies.
